The application aims to serve as a time and attendace keeper for a small-medium organization. Everyday, during workdays a popup will appear on the employee screen, greenting him/her. When the popup is dimissed it will create a record on the server, indicating the time that user has logged in. It will serve as the entry time. At the end of the day, 5 pm in this case, another popup will appear thanking the user for the long day at work. The dismissal time of the popup will be recorded here: https://iniciativaselebi.com/app-asistencia/#
The databse adminsitrator will have a complete log to see the time and attendace of a given user. The system creates a monthly report with warnings, highligting abssences and tardiness.
